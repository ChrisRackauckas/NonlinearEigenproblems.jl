# Tutorial showing how to call solve a NEP defined in python code

## Problem

Julia is a great language, but your problem may for various reasons
not be easy to define in Julia code, e.g., for legacy reasons.
We now show a problem defined in python can be solved
with NEP-PACK.

We assume your problem is defined by two functions:
one that can compute an evaluation of $M(Î»)$ and
one that can form a linear combination of derivatives.
Take the following example (which we save in the current
director in file `mynep.py`).
